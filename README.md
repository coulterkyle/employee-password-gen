## Description

This project was intended to demonstrate my ability to use Javascript and add functionality to websites. This exercise allowed me to use various Javascript principals and logic methods to satisfy the goal of making a useable employee password generator.

You will then be greeted by a series of prompts that allow you to specify the length of the password, as well as, what characters you would like to be included in the password: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols
